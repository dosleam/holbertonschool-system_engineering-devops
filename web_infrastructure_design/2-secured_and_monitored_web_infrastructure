Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design
Overview
This document outlines a robust web infrastructure for www.foobar.com, focusing on advanced security measures and comprehensive monitoring to ensure reliability, user trust, and operational transparency.

Security Features
1. Layered Firewalls
Objective:

Restrict unauthorized access.
Mitigate DDoS and malicious traffic.
Secure internal communication between servers.
Structure:

Firewall 1: Protects external traffic hitting the load balancer.
Firewall 2: Secures traffic between the load balancer and web servers.
Firewall 3: Isolates application servers from unnecessary access.
Firewall 4: Shields the database layer, ensuring only the application servers can query it.
2. Secure Communication with SSL/TLS
Purpose:

Encrypt all communication between users and servers.
Prevent data leaks and eavesdropping.
Boost search engine rankings and user confidence.
Implementation:

SSL certificate for www.foobar.com using TLS 1.3 protocol.
Enforced strong cipher suites and forward secrecy.
Automated certificate renewal via Let's Encrypt or another CA.
Monitoring Components
1. Monitoring Tools and Data Collection
Objective:

Detect anomalies in system performance.
Provide insights into resource utilization and traffic patterns.
Support proactive problem resolution.
Components:

Monitoring Clients: Installed on all servers to collect metrics.
Data Sources:
Server health: CPU, memory, disk usage.
Application performance: Logs, error rates, response times.
Network activity: Bandwidth, connection requests.
2. Queries Per Second (QPS) Monitoring
Role:

Measure the volume of incoming requests to the web servers.
Detect traffic spikes or irregularities.
Ensure resource scaling keeps up with demand.
Tools:

Nginx Status Module: Tracks request handling in real time.
Custom Alerts: Integrated with services like Prometheus and Grafana.
