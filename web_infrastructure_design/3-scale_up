Infrastructure Design
This infrastructure separates roles across dedicated servers for scalability, reliability, and optimized performance. Below is a breakdown of the components and their roles.

1. Web Server
Role: Handles client HTTP requests and serves static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Technology: Nginx for its efficiency in handling multiple concurrent connections.
Benefits:
Reduces the application server's workload by serving static content.
Acts as a security layer, supporting SSL/TLS termination.
2. Application Server
Role: Processes dynamic requests, executes business logic, and interacts with the database.
Technology: Framework-specific servers (e.g., Gunicorn for Python, Node.js for JavaScript).
Benefits:
Decouples business logic processing from request handling.
Enables horizontal scaling for backend services.
3. Database Server
Role: Centralizes data storage and handles queries for reads and writes.
Technology: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data; MongoDB for NoSQL needs.
Benefits:
Dedicated server ensures consistent data management and high availability.
Optimized query handling without affecting other server functions.
4. Load Balancer
Role: Distributes traffic among multiple servers to optimize resource usage and increase reliability.
Technology: HAProxy for its performance and reliability.
Setup:
Clustered for failover protection.
Configured with round-robin or least-connections algorithms.
Benefits:
Prevents overloading of individual servers.
Ensures uninterrupted service even if one server fails.
Infrastructure Overview
Below is a conceptual view of the setup:

Infrastructure Flow
Clients send requests to the Load Balancer.
The Load Balancer distributes requests to multiple Web Servers.
Web Servers forward dynamic requests to the Application Servers.
Application Servers retrieve or store data via the Database Server.

Advantages of This Design
Scalability: Each layer can scale independently to meet demand.
Fault Tolerance: Load balancer and server clustering reduce the risk of downtime.
Performance: Dedicated servers for each role optimize resource usage.
